# Security Implementation and Compliance Requirements

## Overview
This document outlines the security measures and compliance requirements for the Shared Payment System, ensuring data protection, secure transactions, and regulatory compliance.

## Data Protection

### Encryption Standards
```yaml
Data at Rest:
  - Database Encryption: AES-256
  - Field-Level Encryption: For sensitive data (PII, payment details)
  - Key Management: AWS KMS or equivalent
  - Encryption Key Rotation: Every 90 days

Data in Transit:
  - TLS 1.3 for all communications
  - Perfect Forward Secrecy
  - Strong cipher suites
  - Certificate pinning for mobile apps
```

### Sensitive Data Handling
```yaml
PII Protection:
  - Data minimization
  - Purpose limitation
  - Storage limitation
  - Encryption at rest and in transit
  - Access logging and monitoring

Payment Data:
  - Tokenization of payment methods
  - No storage of full card numbers
  - PCI DSS compliance for payment processing
  - Secure vault integration
```

## Authentication Security

### Password Requirements
```yaml
Complexity Rules:
  - Minimum length: 10 characters
  - Must contain: uppercase, lowercase, numbers, special characters
  - Maximum length: 128 characters
  - No common password patterns
  - Password history: Last 5 passwords

Implementation:
  - Argon2id for password hashing
  - Salt length: 16 bytes
  - Pepper for additional security
  - Configurable work factors
```

### Multi-Factor Authentication
```yaml
Methods:
  - Time-based OTP (TOTP)
  - SMS OTP (backup)
  - Email verification codes
  - Hardware security keys (FIDO2)

Security Measures:
  - Rate limiting
  - Expiring codes
  - Device fingerprinting
  - Suspicious activity detection
```

## Authorization Controls

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
```yaml
Roles:
  - System Administrator
  - Primary Payer
  - Participant
  - Meter Reader

Permission Levels:
  - Read
  - Write
  - Delete
  - Approve
  - Manage

Access Control Lists:
  - Resource-level permissions
  - Group-level permissions
  - User-level permissions
```

### Session Management
```yaml
Session Security:
  - JWT with short expiration (15 minutes)
  - Secure token storage
  - Refresh token rotation
  - Concurrent session limits
  - Force logout capability
  - Session activity monitoring
```

## API Security

### API Protection
```yaml
Security Measures:
  - Rate limiting per endpoint
  - Input validation
  - Request size limits

Headers:
  - Content-Security-Policy
  - X-Content-Type-Options
  - X-Frame-Options
  - X-XSS-Protection
  - Strict-Transport-Security
```

### API Authentication
```yaml
Methods:
  - JWT Bearer tokens
  - API keys for service-to-service
  - OAuth2 for third-party integration
  - Client certificates for critical services
```

## Infrastructure Security

### Network Security
```yaml
Measures:
  - Web Application Firewall (WAF)
  - DDoS protection
  - Network segmentation
  - VPC configuration
  - Security groups
  - Access Control Lists (ACLs)
```

### Server Security
```yaml
Hardening:
  - Regular security updates

```

## Compliance Requirements

### Privacy Compliance
```yaml
GDPR-equivalent:
  - Right to access
  - Right to rectification
  - Right to erasure
  - Data portability
  - Privacy by design
  - Data protection impact assessment

Implementation:
  - Privacy notices
  - Consent management
  - Data retention policies
  - Subject access request handling
```

### Financial Compliance
```yaml
Requirements:
  - PCI DSS for payment processing
  - AML compliance
  - KYC procedures
  - Transaction monitoring
  - Audit trails
  - Financial reporting
```

## Security Monitoring

### Logging and Monitoring
```yaml
Log Types:
  - Authentication attempts
  - Authorization decisions
  - Data access logs
  - System changes
  - Security events
  - Performance metrics

Monitoring:
  - Real-time alerts
  - Anomaly detection
  - Security dashboards
  - Compliance reporting
```

### Incident Response
```yaml
Procedures:
  - Incident classification
  - Response procedures
  - Communication plan
  - Recovery process
  - Post-incident analysis
  - Improvement actions
```

## Security Testing

### Regular Assessments
```yaml
Testing Types:
  - Vulnerability scanning
  - Penetration testing
  - Security code reviews
  - Dependency analysis
  - Configuration audits
  - Compliance assessments

Frequency:
  - Automated scans: Daily
  - Vulnerability assessments: Monthly
  - Penetration tests: Quarterly

```

## Data Backup and Recovery

### Backup Strategy
```yaml
Requirements:
  - Daily incremental backups
  - Weekly full backups
